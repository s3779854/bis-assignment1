    <h2>Beyond Current Capabilities</h2>
    <h3>Matthew Andric</h3>
    <p>What would be beyond my current capabilities would be that while I have a good amount of experience with programming, I don’t really have a lot of specific practice with video game programming nor have I used a game engine all that extensively. I would need to research Unity specific knowledge as well as general game programming knowledge for this project. I also don’t have a lot of experience with art which will be a part of this project that I may be able to get some practice in to contribute for the final assignment. </p>
    
    <h3>Hien Tran</h3> 
    <p>My Java knowledge is very basic from completing only an Introduction to Programming course, and I have minimal knowledge about game development. Coding is not intuitive to me, but I do find it to be very fascinating, and so I believe this project will greatly extend my coding skills. Working with a team to make a game is new to me and to improve my teamwork and communication skills, it will require me to get out of my comfort zone. </p>
    
    <h3>Junshuo Su</h3>
    <p>I have the basic capabilities on JAVA/C# programming. Honestly, coding was not my very confident area to develop a game. So, this project will be a big challenge to me. However, I will try to improve my coding skills by going into the Unity technologies during this project. That could be a great opportunity to improve my IT skills. </p>
    
    <h3>Angela Mao</h3>
    <p>Programming is beyond my current capabilities as I know only basic concepts in programming, and even then, programming for game development may be different from programming other things so it will be completely new for me. Furthermore, the project will require me to use Unity which is a program where I have no experience whatsoever. Designing is one of my stronger points in the project as I have experience with art and art programs, however I may not be excellent at it as it is objective. This project requires that I research extensively on Unity and its programming language, research game design tips and improve my designing and art skills in order to enhance my capabilities. </p>
    
    <h3>Ziqiang Lin</h3>
    <p>I have the basic knowledge of Java and HTML coding skills. In this project, we need to use Unity to create our game, which is a whole new thing that I have to learn. It would take time for me to get familiar with it. But through learn Unity it would develop my skills of coding and gets me more familiar with the concept of coding and the ability to take new stuff. Also, designing is always my weakness. I want to develop my designing skills through this project from designing the character and monster model with the team.</p>
    
    <h2>Project Risk</h2>
    
    <h3>Insufficient use of time</h3>
    <p>This project contains a lot of software and code that we have never used before. It requires times to learn how to use them. The team might end up spending too much time in learning the code and system and don't have time in implementing many features. Also, when work is not appropriately assigned, in certain stages group member may not be sure about what they need to do and just wait for instruction. This can be solved by making a good plan and timetable from the start so each member can have a clear direction of where the whole time is heading.</p>
    
    <h3>Game crash due to unnoticed game bug</h3>
    <p>Since our team is making a game, there is always going to be some problem with the code that would cause the game to crash. To avoid this to happen, multiple tests should be taken before release the final product and always tell different people to play around with it so they can find the problem that has not been detected before.</p>
    
    <h3>Final product are quiet different from the project description and scope</h3>
    <p>From this long period of designing and implementing, there would be a lot of new ideas and feature gets to put into the game. So it becomes crucial that we make sure the product is related to the aim that was made before. This can be fixed when people just look up into the project description when they implementing new features and have some discussion within the group can also resolve the confusion.</p>
    
    <h2>Team Dynamic Challenge</h2>
    <h3>Low engagement </h3>
    <p>Making everyone contribute is an essential thing in a team. If only one or two people is putting effort in a six people project, the final product would not a disaster because not enough work would be done in it. To gain the engagement from the team would require the team member to share the idea effectively, so everyone gets some feature in the game they are interested in because work towards things that motivate us is always an exciting thing to do. More importantly, the group should listen and discuss each other’s though so no one gets left out.</p>
    
    <h3>Not sharing information</h3>
    <p>Even with everyone in the team contributes to the group work, there would be a scenario where every just work on their own, and product work that have little or just no connection to each other. When the problem gets noticed when everyone put their final piece together, it would be to late to fix it. So the team would need to have some knowledge in what the other is doing a have a general direction in how the final product would look like. This requires a lot of communication in the team, and from those communications, the team will together form a perfect product.</p>
    
    <h3>Conflict in workload</h3>
    <p>Sometime when assigning work to members, people don’t agree with the amount of work they receive and result in some kind of conflict in the group.  So it is vital to make sure that everyone gets a say in how to separate the workload within several topics when there is disagreement talk through as a team, so everyone gets an equal amount of work they need to do and avoid unnecessary conflict in the team.</p>
